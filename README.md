- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ancel-IMI
- 👀 I’m interested in Network Optimization with a concentration on supply chain networks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on our product GNOMAE (General Network Optimal Modeler And Engine). Traditionally, optimizations are accomplished using Mixed Integer Linear Programming 
      with some advanced applications allowing for the approximation of cost curves with piece-wise linear functions. GNOMAE is based on a proprietary mathematical proof
      which allows for both reduced time-to-solve and increased network size and complexity.
